# Scanimage-planes3d

New feature for Scanimage 5.1* to rotate and move the imaging plane in 3D. Movement of third mirror controls the focal spot position along the optical axis using the remote focusing principle. The piezo motor moving the mirror is controlled by Scanimage. Added functionality in the GUI allows the user to freely rotate the imaging plane in 3D. The master branch contains the original version of Scanimage 5.1. The branch 'Planes3D' contains the new features.
